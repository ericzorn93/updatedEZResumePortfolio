    <h2 class="subHeaderText">In this project, I have focused on an application that has already been on the market previously and is called Zip. The Zip application happens to be already on the app store and is a question/answer application. The point of the application is for the user to be able to ask a two-answer based question. The user can answer other peopleâ€™s questions by swiping either right or left to answer the question based on how they feel. What I have done is to completely redesign the application via a new UX and UI design format. I have kept most of their branding; however, most people probably would misconstrue their original red and green color scheme as a Christmas theme. Therefore, I have changed the palette to do different shades of green and black, with white accents. The app has been completely sketched, wire framed, comped, critiqued, and prototyped. The software that I have mastered for this prototyping is named InVision and is a widely-used application in the UX/UI field.</h2>

   <h2 class="projectTitle">About my Project</h2>
   <br>
   <p class="projectParagraph">This application was designed for my UX/UI and mobile app design course. The original application was found on the iOS application store and tended to have really bad user experience and user interface techniques. My goal is to redesign the user experience and user interface for the Zip App and to redesign a color palette, logo, and any other branding techniques that went along with the application. I also used the professional prototyping application, known as InVision in order to create a working prototype. At the bottom of this projects page, you can see walk-through of the original application that was found on my iPhone, as well as the reviews. Within a video at the end is also a walk-through of the current applicationAnd the prototype that I have redesigned through InVision. Enjoy!</p>
