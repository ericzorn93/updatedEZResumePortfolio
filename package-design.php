    <h2 class="subHeaderText">In this box project, I was redesigning the original pretzel box of the Snyderâ€™s Sourdough Pretzels. This was redesigned for their new flavor of honey-mustard pretzels. I went for more of a typographic and vector based approach to their original product. The box uses the mustard color of the mustard that is being used with the pretzels and the shade of brown that the pretzels utilize.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="subHeaderText">For the first project within package design, I have drafted and constructed a project for an Italian Peanut Butter company, named Burro di Arachidi. In Italian, this directly translates to Peanut Butter. The reason that I have chosen to go with this company name and style of Peanut Butter is because we had to choose a brand with a more premium sales pitch and strategy. The Burro di Arachidi name makes the Peanut Butter have a more premium sounding name. It has been properly printed and exported to be 3-Dimensional logo and product via Adobe Illustrator. Images of the product can be seen on this page of the portfolio.</h2>

   <br>
   <p class="projectParagraph"><strong>Project 1 (Jar/Bottle): </strong>This project has been completed in my pacakge design class. We have been given the task of recreating the packaging and branding behind the product and its packaging that had already been there from the beginning. I have chosen to make both a peanut butter label for a jar for an original company. The peanut butter branding was to choose the original packaging of a peanutbuttern brand and make it up scale to fit a more expensive market. That is why I chose to name the company <strong><em>Burro di Arachidi.</em></strong></p>
   
   <p class="projectParagraph"><strong>Project 2 (Box): </strong>Our second project was to find the branding behind different boxed packaging and relate their branding to a new product on their product line. I had chosen to choose the famous pretzel brand, <strong><em>Snyder's of Hanover</em></strong> , and have recreated their branding for their Honey-Mustard pretzels. Their colors of brown and gold for their honey-mustard color are carried throughout the different panels within the box. Everyone should be able to properly identify what flavor the pretzels are and what company they are baked from. This is portrayed by the original <strong><em>Snyder's of Hanover</em></strong> logo and color palette.</p>
