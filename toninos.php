We were given the task of completely redesigning and coding the website from scratch. I used parallax and other CSS techniques to make the site responsive and appear to the user.</h2>

   <br>
   <p class="projectParagraph">The goal of this project was to research a restaraunt that was local to Quinnipiac University and to redesign its presence and user experience. I chose to redesign and complete the Tonino's Pizzeria website that is located here in Hamden, CT. Their website seems to work sufficiently, but still could benefit tremendously from a facelift. I have incorporated many different aspects of modern web design to this project. I have included parallax scrolling as the dividers and header images within the home page and the different menu pages. All images are very high quality and highlight the section of food that they are describing and advertising to the user. I also have embedded locations using iFrames and Google APIs within the contact page as well. Lastly, I have also included a modern and animated navigation meny at the top-left of the website using some jQuery and CSS.</p>
