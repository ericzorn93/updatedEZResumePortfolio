    <h2 class="subHeaderText">This website was one of my first websites that I had ever built using HTML and CSS. The band Patch Kit was a local band that performed here in Hamden, CT at the space. I went to the concert, and did research about the band. The band consists of 4 members and gives a grunge/emo theme to their music that is displayed through the grunge-styled website that I had created. The website displays their music, a contact form, a jQuery photo gallery, and social media icons.

   <h2 class="projectTitle">About my Project</h2>
   <br>
   <p class="projectParagraph">This project was one of the first websites that I had ever started building within my Interactive Digital Design major. The website task was to visit a band that had been performing locally within the New Haven area. We were then told to interview the band and find their brand focus and music genre. They turned out to be artists of a grunge/emo based music type. I utilized this and built a simple site including their music, imagery with a CSS based gallery, and a button navigation at the bottom. It reflects their grunge/emo genre and with the different textures, generates an appealing look to their audience and fans.</p>
